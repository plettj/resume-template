# Josiah's Resume Template

A single-page, simple, and unique resume for students. It uses tables and custom fonts, with full customizability within Google Docs.

I designed this resume for two things:
- To stand out among the sea of applicants both with the style and the content, and
- To be easy for recruiters to parse or skim with there extremely limitted time.

## Quick start

Get started quickly with the [Google Docs Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DSZTeTYUqw1qaoQoHbCTz6qI2u9GYhBE?usp=sharing).

Along with the [Resume Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vqKO43n_pdI88WHLV8P0XTo5Di0dLs60jQE7jo5Hs28/edit?usp=sharing), the folder includes a matching [Cover Letter Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHIwiWNlZZiCybMPwaVzu3oWf4fcuGt85YWM7d-kpQU/edit?usp=sharing) and [Supplemental Document Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e4YsaIP7tsiI6jmOJDxDNuNiRnJqhhMNrS8XAap-cFE/edit?usp=sharing).
