# Josiah's Resume Template

A single-page, simple, and unique resume for students. It uses tables and custom fonts, with full customizability within Google Docs.

I designed this resume for two things:
- To stand out among the sea of applicants both with the style and the content, and
- To be easy for recruiters to parse or skim with there extremely limitted time.

## Quick start

Get started quickly with the [Google Docs Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DSZTeTYUqw1qaoQoHbCTz6qI2u9GYhBE?usp=sharing).

Along with the [Resume Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vqKO43n_pdI88WHLV8P0XTo5Di0dLs60jQE7jo5Hs28/edit?usp=sharing), the folder includes a matching [Cover Letter Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHIwiWNlZZiCybMPwaVzu3oWf4fcuGt85YWM7d-kpQU/edit?usp=sharing) and [Supplemental Document Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e4YsaIP7tsiI6jmOJDxDNuNiRnJqhhMNrS8XAap-cFE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Resume Theory Discussion

If you're a student, I highly recommend reading these before you dive into your first job search.

1. Recruiters spend an average of only **7-9 seconds reviewing** each resume ([source](https://www.tealhq.com/post/how-long-recruiters-spend-reviewing-resume))

Make sure your biggest points are attention-grabbing. On my resume, the first few words are bolded on almost every bullet point, to draw a skimming eye in; and those words are carefully chosen.

2. Including one bad bullet point decreases the **value of all your good points** by about 1/3 ([source](https://lukaszrzepinski.wordpress.com/2014/01/06/interesting-economy-experiment/))

A set of 16 dishes where 1 is broken is appraised by pawn shop owners at a _far_ lower value than a pristine set of 10 dishes. So, get rid of most of your bullet points. Based on the 40+ student resumes I've reviewed, on average, 5 bullet points for a job should be reduced to 2, where one is a mish-mash of some of the original points.

3. Placing negative qualifiers last vastly increases your chances of a **favourable misinterpretation** by a recruiter (research + my experience)

I used to have `Nominated for UW Co-op Student of the Year` as my main bullet point for a job. But I came across a research paper that demonstrated the number one way to improve the wording of your resume is to put negative qualifiers last, because people don't read all the way and end up missing the qualifier. So I changed it to `UW Co-op Student of the Year nominee`, and lo and behold, multiple interviewers thought I had won! So go change your `Participated in X hackathon` point to `X Hackathon participant`, folks.

## Upcoming

I hope to make a LaTeX version of this resume at some point in the near future.
